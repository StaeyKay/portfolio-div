Created by Esther Kwashie using HTML, external CSS, Tailwind CSS and JavaScript

The following HTML files were created for different pages of the portfolio
HTML files: index.html, about.html, portfolio.html, resume.html, contact.html

The following CSS files were created for different pages of the portfolio
CSS files: styles.css, about.css, portfolio.css, resume.css, contact.css

The following JavaScript files were created for different pages of the portfolio
JavaScript files: script.js, about.js, portfolio.js, contact.js

To use Tailwind CSS, I installed it using npm and then used the following command to build the CSS file:
